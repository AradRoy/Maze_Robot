Arduino-based robotic navigation competition

The target is to get from a random starting point on a line at one end of the room to the furthest line at the other end in as little time as possible.
In front there will be obstacles of various types: "I", "L" and "U" shape at a height of at least 9 cm from the floor. There are also cubes in sizes 10X10X10 cm that may be scattered between line 2 and line 3.
In any case the minimum spacing for the passage does not fall below 200 mm.
An autonomous system must be designed that can bypass the obstacles and reach the farthest line, in minimal time, when the orientation and location of the obstacles are not known to you in advance.
Only two sensors that were supplied with the robot may be used: light and ultrasonic.
Parts of a robot can be added / replaced, but not parts
Electronics / motors. An alternate voltage source can be used, as long as it is carried on the robot. From the moment the robot is activated on the track, it cannot be touched
Or communicate with him in any form.
To orient yourself in the space, a 500-watt projector will be installed in the center of line 3 (the finish line (about 20 cm above the floor). You can use the light sensor
Pp. To correct the orientation of your robot in the space after the slides and so on.
A score will be given according to the line and according to the time, when there is normalization between those who arrive at the line according to the time.
For example for line 1 you can get 85-80, where the one who arrived the fastest gets 85 and the rest are normalized after him.
For line 2 you can get 90-85, with the one who arrived the fastest getting 90 and the rest normalizing after him.
For line 3 you can get 100-90 when the one who arrived the fastest gets 100 and the rest are normalized after him.
If all members of the group reached line 3, the normalization will be only according to time (100-80.)
Will give a bonus for designing / stabilizing the robot.
You can test your robot in class whenever it is available. Please leave the class tidy at the end of the test.
At the beginning of the second semester, there will be another and more challenging competition between all the winners from all the teams. Please save the vehicles.
The code can be improved for this contest
